Basic app for playing Tic-Tac-Toe against AI implemented using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.\
In the `python` directory there's a desktop app made with `Tkinter` and in `js` directory there's a web app
made with Javascript.\
Reason for two very different approaches is because I made a desktop app first and then tried to migrate
it to a web app with Flask. In doing so I realised it would be better to use already made logic 
and learn some JavaScript with Node.js.
