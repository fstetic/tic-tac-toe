In python directory there is a desktop app and in js directory there is a web app 
for playing Tic-Tac-Toe against AI implemented using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.\
Reason for two very different approaches is because I made a desktop app first and then tried to migrate
it to a web app with Flask. In doing so I realised it would be better to use already made logic 
and learn some JavaScript with Node.js.
